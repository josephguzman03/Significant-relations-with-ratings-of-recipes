# Significant relations with ratings of recipes
This is a DSC80 project at UC San Diego. Which focus on finding a relationship between the caloric value and its average rating. As well as that of the average number of recipes required and its average rating.

## Introduction

Our project focuses on a dataset 'recipe' which, which takes into account the recipe provided by a user, along with any information attached to it, such as: the date of publishing, nutritional value, average ratings etc. Throughout the process of this experiment, we kept on digging deeper to find a question that would help answer an important question, that is not only related to the dataframe, but also helps analyze the human behavior when it came to choosing between recipes. We finally narrowed down to our Question of Interest which is:

**Does the calories specified of a recipe, affect the average ratings of that recipe itself?**

Our dataset initially consisted of 83,782 rows and 13 columns. Through through the process of data cleansing however, we narrowed it down to 8 columns of which are:
- `name` : The name of the recipe provided
- `id` : The id tag provided for each recipe
- `minutes` : The time taken to execute the recipe
- `contributor_id` : The personal id for the individual
- `n_steps` : Takes into account the number of steps needed to execute the recipe
- `n_ingredients` : The number of ingredients required for the recipe
- `average_rating` : The average rating the recipe received on a scale of 0 to 5
- `calories` : The calories present per recipe

## Cleaning and EDA

**Data Cleaning**

In order to make the dataframe more easily understandable, as well as easier to work with, we began by removing columns that were irrelevent to the topic that we were working on. This not only made it easier to work with the dataframe, but it also helped in making the dataframe run faster, thus saving us more time.
We columns which we removed were:
- `description` : Gives a breif description of the recipe which the user might prepare
- `steps` : Gives an overview of the process in order to make the recipe
- `submitted` : Gives the date of publishing
- `tags` : Gives a slogan under which the recipe comes under
- `ingredients` : Gives a list of ingredients one may need to complete the recipe

As you can see from the desctiption below, none of the columns which we've dropped have anything to do with *our project*, since none of them coorelate with the calories of the recipe.

Now that we finished dropping the columns, we also needed to form a new column `first_nutrition`, which takes the `nutrition` column, and returns the first value of the list for each individual row. No that this new column is formed, there no use for the `nutrition` column anymore, so we can remove that too.

After we form the nutrition column, we need to ensure that there are no duplicates in the column, as to not cause any faulty reading, however, before doing that, we need to take into account the average rating, to ensure that the mean of all the ratings per recipe are taking into account. Moreover, we will also replace all values marked as **NaN** with a 0, to ensure that no value is left out.

```py
# First we had to combined both the csv files into one dataset. 
recipes = pd.read_csv('food_data/RAW_recipes.csv')
interactions = pd.read_csv('food_data/RAW_interactions.csv')

merged = pd.merge(recipes, interactions, left_on='id', right_on='recipe_id', how='left')

merged['rating'].replace(0, np.nan, inplace=True) 
average_rating_per_recipe = merged.groupby('id')['rating'].mean()
recipes = pd.merge(recipes, average_rating_per_recipe, left_on='id', right_index=True, how='left')
recipes.rename(columns={'rating': 'average_rating'}, inplace=True)

# recipes is a dataset that has both recipes and interactions
recipes

# Now we had to clean and appropiate our data with the necessary items for our research. 
recipes_cleaned = recipes.drop(columns=['description','steps','submitted','tags','ingredients'])
recipes_cleaned['calories'] = recipes_cleaned['nutrition'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[0][1:]).astype(float)
recipes_cleaned = recipes_cleaned.drop(columns = ['nutrition'])
average_rating_mean = recipes_cleaned['average_rating'].mean()
recipes_cleaned['average_rating'].fillna(average_rating_mean, inplace=True)
recipes_cleaned = recipes_cleaned.drop_duplicates()
recipes_cleaned['name'].fillna(np.nan, inplace=True)

# Finally, recipes_cleaned is the final output of data.
recipes_cleaned.head()
