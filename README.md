# Significant Relations With Ratings of Recipes

Welcome to our Data Science 80 (DSC80) project at UC San Diego, where we delve into the captivating realm of culinary exploration. Our project centers around unraveling the intricate relationship between the caloric content of recipes and their corresponding average ratings. This research unfolds across four distinct sections: *Introduction*, *Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*, *Assessment of Missingness*, and *Hypothesis Testing*.

In a world where culinary experiences intertwine with daily life, understanding the dynamics of the food we consume becomes paramount. Our curiosity was piqued when we pondered the possibility of a connection between the caloric value of recipes and the subjective measure of their enjoyment—the average rating. It dawned on us that recipes, as a tangible source of consumption, might share similarities with platforms like Yelp reviews and food blogs, where qualitative assessments often intertwine with quantitative elements.

Food is not merely a means of sustenance; it is a cultural, social, and sensory experience. By exploring the correlation between caloric value and ratings, we aim to uncover patterns that extend beyond the plate. This analysis may provide insights into dietary preferences, nutritional awareness, and the complex interplay between flavor and health.

Our journey begins with a meticulous exploration of the dataset, unraveling its nuances to form a cohesive narrative. As we navigate through the stages of data cleaning, EDA, assessment of missingness, and hypothesis testing, we aim to unearth compelling findings that resonate with both food enthusiasts and data aficionados alike.

## Introduction

Our project centers around a comprehensive exploration of the `recipe` dataset, a diverse repository encompassing user-provided recipes along with associated metadata, including the date of publishing, nutritional value, and average ratings. Amidst the myriad of possibilities, our quest for a meaningful question led us to unravel a profound aspect not only concerning the dataset but also shedding light on the intricacies of human behavior in the realm of culinary choices.

In our pursuit of a question, we meticulously examined the dataset, aiming to pose an inquiry that could unravel deeper insights into the dynamics of recipe selection. The question that emerged as the focal point of our investigation is:

**Does the specified caloric content of a recipe influence its average ratings?**

This inquiry delves into the nexus between the nutritional aspect of a recipe, as quantified by its caloric value, and the subjective assessment of its appeal measured by average ratings. As we navigate through this exploration, we aim to decipher whether the nutritional profile of a recipe plays a discernible role in shaping the overall perception and appreciation of the culinary creation.

Initially comprising 83,782 rows and 13 columns, our dataset underwent meticulous data cleansing to refine its essence. The distilled dataset now features 8 key columns, each contributing unique facets to our analysis:
- `name` : The distinctive name assigned to each recipe.
- `id` : A unique identifier tagging each recipe for reference.
- `minutes` : The time required for the execution of the recipe.
- `contributor_id` : A personal identifier linking each recipe to its contributor.
- `n_steps` : The number of steps involved in the recipe's execution.
- `n_ingredients` : The count of ingredients essential for the recipe.
- `average_rating` : The average rating garnered by the recipe on a scale ranging from 0 to 5.
- `calories` : The caloric content per serving of the recipe.

As we embark on this analytical journey, these refined attributes serve as the foundation for unraveling the intricate relationship between caloric value and average ratings, providing a nuanced understanding of the interplay between nutritional components and culinary acclaim.

## Cleaning and EDA

**Data Cleaning**

To enhance the clarity and efficiency of our dataframe, we initiated a strategic refinement process aimed at excluding columns unrelated to the specific focus of our project. This not only streamlined our interaction with the dataframe but also contributed to a noticeable improvement in its processing speed, consequently optimizing our time utilization.

The removed columns encompassed elements deemed irrelevant to our analytical endeavors, such as:

- `description` : Providing a brief overview of the recipe, potentially aiding users in preparation.
- `steps` : Outlining the procedural details for crafting the recipe.
- `submitted` : Indicating the date of recipe publication.
- `tags` : Gives a slogan under which the recipe comes under
- `ingredients` : Enumerating the necessary components for completing the recipe.

Evidently, as articulated in the following description, none of the excised columns bore any relevance to the core objective of our *project*, as they failed to exhibit any correlation with the caloric content of the recipes.

Having successfully pruned the dataframe, our attention turned to the creation of a new column, namely `first_nutrition`. This column extracted the initial value from the `nutrition` column for each respective row. With this addition, the `nutrition` column became redundant, prompting its removal.

Subsequent to the introduction of the `first_nutrition` column, a meticulous quality check ensued. This involved the elimination of duplicates to prevent inaccuracies in data interpretation. However, prior to this step, consideration was given to the `average_rating` column to ensure the inclusion of its influence on the mean of all ratings per recipe. Additionally, any instances marked as **NaN** were replaced with 0 to prevent any inadvertent exclusion of values from our analysis. This comprehensive approach ensures the integrity and reliability of our dataset as we delve into the intricate relationship between caloric content and recipe ratings.

```py
# First we had to combined both the csv files into one dataset. 
recipes = pd.read_csv('food_data/RAW_recipes.csv')
interactions = pd.read_csv('food_data/RAW_interactions.csv')

merged = pd.merge(recipes, interactions, left_on='id', right_on='recipe_id', how='left')

merged['rating'].replace(0, np.nan, inplace=True) 
average_rating_per_recipe = merged.groupby('id')['rating'].mean()
recipes = pd.merge(recipes, average_rating_per_recipe, left_on='id', right_index=True, how='left')
recipes.rename(columns={'rating': 'average_rating'}, inplace=True)

# recipes is a dataset that has both recipes and interactions
recipes

# Now we had to clean and appropiate our data with the necessary items for our research. 
recipes_cleaned = recipes.drop(columns=['description','steps','submitted','tags','ingredients'])
recipes_cleaned['calories'] = recipes_cleaned['nutrition'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[0][1:]).astype(float)
recipes_cleaned = recipes_cleaned.drop(columns = ['nutrition'])
average_rating_mean = recipes_cleaned['average_rating'].mean()
recipes_cleaned['average_rating'].fillna(average_rating_mean, inplace=True)
recipes_cleaned = recipes_cleaned.drop_duplicates()
recipes_cleaned['name'].fillna(np.nan, inplace=True)

# Finally, recipes_cleaned is the final output of data.
recipes_cleaned.head()
```

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**Univariate Analysis**

For the univariate analysis, we opted for a multifaceted approach, conducting the examination through three distinct forms. Each graph is accompanied by a descriptive analysis, elucidating its relevance to our research and the insights it contributes. The choice of utilizing bar graphs was deliberate, as this visualization method provided a nuanced perspective, enhancing our comprehension of the distributional dynamics inherent in the dataset. This deliberate selection of graphical representation aimed to unravel and articulate the intricate relationships embedded within the data, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of our research objectives.

" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>


Initiating our exploration, we investigated the distribution of caloric values in recipes, revealing a predominant concentration of lower caloric values. Despite a seemingly sparse dataset with a bin size of 100, discernible correlations emerged, hinting at an underlying relationship and prompting further exploration into the nuanced dynamics of caloric values within our dataset.


<iframe src="assets/UA_new_Distribution_of_Recipe_Ratings.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>


Continuing our exploration, we begain to examine the distribution of recipe ratings, revealing a substantial majority with higher ratings. This intriguing observation prompts further investigation into the factors contributing to the prevalent trend of elevated ratings within our dataset.

<iframe src="assets/UANew_Distribution_of Number_of_Ingredients_in_Recipes.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>


Concluding our univariate analysis, we observed a bell-shaped trend in the distribution of the number of ingredients, with the peak indicating the average number per recipe. This distinctive pattern invites further scrutiny, prompting exploration into the significance and implications of this central tendency within our dataset.


**Bivariate Analysis**

Transitioning into our bivariate analysis, our objective was to unveil potential correlations between caloric value, the number of ingredients, and their collective impact on average ratings. To effectively depict the intricate relationships within these variables, we opted for the use of scatter plots. This graphical approach affords us the ability to visually articulate the dimensional interplay between our chosen parameters, facilitating a nuanced exploration of their mutual influence on recipe ratings.

<iframe src="assets/BA_Correlation_between_Average_Rating_and_Caloric_Value.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Initially, our observation of the scatter plots revealed a sparse distribution of data points across the axes. Particularly notable is the prevalence of points in the lower left quadrants, indicating a distinct count pattern where lower caloric values align with higher average ratings. 

<iframe src="assets/BA_Correlation_between_Average_Rating_and_Number_of_Ingredients.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Additionally, upon closer examination of the data, a significant cluster becomes apparent, particularly in scenarios where the average rating is higher and the number of ingredients is lower. Although the distribution appears spanning across both axes, a subtle underlying trend is discernible.


**Interesting Aggregates**

Concluding our analysis, during the aggregation of our dataset, we directed our attention to exploring the relationship between `n_ingredients` and `first_nutrition` with `average_rating` to delve deeper into the realm of numeric data. This strategic focus aims to unravel additional layers of insights embedded within the dataset, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the numerical dynamics at play.

```py
agg_by_ingredients = recipes_cleaned.groupby('n_ingredients')['average_rating'].agg(['mean', 'count']).reset_index()
agg_by_ingredients.head()

## Assessment of Missingness

**NMAR Analysis**

When conducting the NMAR Analysis, we were familar about how the missignness data within columns may affect outcomes of other columns. Upon, looking at our datasets we found that columns that we consider to be NMAR, would `average_ratings`. This is because while looking at our dataframe, we realised that only two columns that had any possible null values: `name` as well as `average_ratings`, and thus we chose `average_ratings`. Moreover, with the help of our *Univariate and Bivariant Analysis* we obsereved that within the scattarplots itself, a mojority of the points were clustered around certain values, which led to us to decide that the `average_ratings` column had some sort of corelation with its dependency.

**Missing Depedency**

To start off, we needed to compare null and non-null values of the `first_nutritution` distributions for `ratings`. We needed to seperate our data to its own data sets because, mentioned earlier, we needed to replace null values for average ratings to conduct our analysis. We decided to cateogrize our calorical values as it would better suit the comparison and provide insight on the relationship between the calories and rating. 

```py
def group(calorie):
    if calorie <= 100:
        return 'Too Low'
    if 100 < calorie <= 300:
        return 'Low'
    elif 300 < calorie <= 800:
        return 'Healthy'
    elif 800 < calorie <= 1200:
        return 'High'
    else:
        return 'Excessive'
```
Now we decided to clean up our dataset again, without filling in `np.nan`. 

```py
missing_rating = recipes.drop(columns=['description','steps','submitted','tags','ingredients'])
missing_rating['first_nutrition'] = missing_rating['nutrition'].apply(lambda x: x.split(',')[0][1:]).astype(float)
missing_rating = missing_rating.drop(columns = ['nutrition'])
missing_rating['tracker'] = missing_rating['first_nutrition'].apply(group)
missing_rating['missing_rating'] = pd.isna(missing_rating['average_rating'])
missing_rating.head()
```

| name                                 |     id |   minutes |   contributor_id |   n_steps |   n_ingredients |   average_rating |   first_nutrition | tracker   | missing_rating   |

| 1 in canada chocolate chip cookies   | 453467 |        45 |          1848091 |        12 |              11 |                5 |             595.1 | Healthy   | False            |
| 412 broccoli casserole               | 306168 |        40 |            50969 |         6 |               9 |                5 |             194.8 | Low       | False            |
| millionaire pound cake               | 286009 |       120 |           461724 |         7 |               7 |                5 |             878.3 | High      | False            |
| 2000 meatloaf                        | 475785 |        90 |          2202916 |        17 |              13 |                5 |             267   | Low       | False            |

We then created a pivot table of the missing calorical values for each respective `tracker`. 


| tracker   |     False |      True |
|:----------|----------:|----------:|
| Excessive | 0.0403213 | 0.0670755 |
| Healthy   | 0.413204  | 0.415102  |
| High      | 0.0538849 | 0.0678421 |
| Low       | 0.377207  | 0.340744  |
| Too Low   | 0.115383  | 0.109237  |
 

 Down below is a visual example of the table above as a bar histogram. 

 INSERT GRAPH

```py
observed_tvd = calorie_dist.diff(axis=1).iloc[:, -1].abs().sum()/ 2
 ```
The observeed TVD is 0.0426.

 INSERT GRAPH


After collecting our permutation, We reject the null. We stated that the null of  distribution of  `tracker` when `ratings` is missing, would come fromfrom the same as the distribution of 'tracker' when 'ratings' is not missing. Rejecting the null, allowed us to conclude that the missingness in the `ratings` column is **dependent** on `tracker`.

## Hypothesis Testing

Futhering our analysis, we still yet have to get to the bottom of our question: Does the calories specified of a recipe, affect the average ratings of that recipe itself?

For the purpose of our analysis, we will consider recipies higher than or equal to 4.0, to be high-rating.

*`Null Hypothesis (**H0**)`:*
In the population, the caloric values in restaurants with less than 4 stars and those with greater than or equal to 4 stars have the same distribution.

*`Alternative Hypothesis (**H1**)`:*
In the population, recipes with a rating higher than 4 stars have a lower caloric value than recipes with a rating lower than 4 stars, on average.


*`Permutation Testing`:*
In order to find the p value, and decide whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis we used the *Absolute Mean test statistic*, since it seemed to be the best fit for this. We worked on different significant levels starting from 0.01 all the way to 0.1, and decided to stick with the significant level(α) of 0.1 since it would allow us to see if there was any possible trend between the caloric value of the recipe as well as its rating.

```py
recipies_Hyp = recipes_cleaned[['average_rating','first_nutrition']].copy()
recipies_Hyp['high_rating'] = recipies_Hyp['average_rating'] >= 4.0
recipies_Hyp['high_rating'] = recipies_Hyp['high_rating'].astype(bool)
recipies_Hyp.head()
```

|   average_rating |   first_nutrition | high_rating   |
|-----------------:|------------------:|:--------------|
|                4 |             138.4 | True          |
|                5 |             595.1 | True          |
|                5 |             194.8 | True          |
|                5 |             878.3 | True          |
|                5 |             267   | True          |


<iframe src="assets/comparison.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Given that this is soley for comparison, we can identify patterns within the data.

Continuing with our research, we conducted a permutation with `n_repetitions = 1000` using our testing statistic, to measure out different instances of the mean. 


```py
observed_difference = recipies_Hyp.groupby('high_rating')['first_nutrition'].mean().diff().iloc[-1]
```

The observed_difference is -15.6866. This is then stated over at our empirical distribution over our simulation. 

<iframe src="assets/empirical_distribution.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

Therefore, The p-value which we obtained was 0.077, thus we could Reject the Null Hypothesis. With the help of this test we were able to figure that there is a relationship between the caloric value of a recipe as well as its average rating, however this is simply a trend.

It's important to emphasize that statistical significance does not imply practical significance, and the results should be interpreted in the context of the study and its limitations.
